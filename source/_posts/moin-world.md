Hello or "Moin! Moin!" how you would say in Northern Germany.

My name is Dominik Kundel, I'm a software developer from Bremen, Germany and currently working as a developer evangelist for [Twilio](https://wwww.twilio.com) from Berlin, Germany.

I recently found this domain as available and figured it's the perfect opportunity to create a new blog. I'll be writing about all sorts of coding related topics but you can be guaranteed that a lot of it will be about [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), JavaScript and the web in general and maybe some Swift ðŸ™‚.

This blog is powered by [Hexo](https://hexo.io) and will be fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/dkundel/moin.world).
