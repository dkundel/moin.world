Hi! 

This blog is run by [Dominik Kundel](https://twitter.com/dkundel). I'm a developer with a passion for JavaScript and the web in general. Currently I'm also learning how to do iOS development with Swift and I'm a Developer Evangelist at Twilio. I tweet under [@dkundel](https://twitter.com/dkundel), push code on [GitHub at dkundel](https://github.com/dkundel), [speak at conferences](http://lanyrd.com/profile/dkundel/) and [post the slides on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/dkundel).

You can find an overview of all my technical writing and talks on my GitHub:

If you have any questions for me feel free to send me a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dkundel) or via email [dkundel@twilio.com](mailto:dkundel@twilio.com)

Enjoy this blog!
